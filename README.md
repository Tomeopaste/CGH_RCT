rcrossref use case

This repo is to house a use case for the rOpenSci library: https://discuss.ropensci.org/c/usecases/10

The use case originates from an original research article investigating whether there are any differences in citations rates between papers published (1) online only or (2) online and in a print issue of Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology. The resulting manuscript (doi 0.1016/j.cgh.2024.10.002, PMID 39433074) demonstrated no differences in citation rates during the 12 months following the print issue release date. Citation: Fasiha Kanwal, Gina Reitenauer, Thoba Khumalo Petrovic, Nicholas J Tomeo, Yan Liu, Aaron P Thrift. Online-Only vs Conventional Publication of Original Research Articles: A Randomized Controlled Trial. Clin Gastroenterol Hepatol. 2024 Oct 19:S1542-3565(24)00908-X. doi:10.1016/j.cgh.2024.10.002.
